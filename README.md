## Building

Download the [ScriptHookV SDK](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) and extract it's contents to ScriptHookV_SDK. 
Clone this repository to the same folder ScriptHookV_SDK was extracted so you have ScriptHookV_SDK and SlamIt in the same folder.
Also clone GTAVManualTransmission since this project refers to those classes.

# Todo until V1.0 release

Patching wheel set/reset instructions.
