# SlamIt

~~Just a small script to damage vehicle wheels/suspensions so much, the car drops. There are two levels of dropping depending on damage.~~
Woop it now changes the wheel struct members but still needs patching and physics is glitchy.

## Building

Download the [ScriptHookV SDK](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) and extract it's contents to ScriptHookV_SDK. 
Clone this repository to the same folder ScriptHookV_SDK was extracted so you have ScriptHookV_SDK and SlamIt in the same folder.
Also clone GTAVManualTransmission since this refers to those classes.
